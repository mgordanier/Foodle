## Foodle

Foodle is a mobile-friendly, accessible web application where you can efficiently coordinate and choose a restaurant with your friends in New York City. An organizer can create the event, share a link with others and have friends vote on a restaurant poll based on location and food preferences. A piechart is rendered visually to tally all the responses for that event. Made specifically for indecisive foodlers!
